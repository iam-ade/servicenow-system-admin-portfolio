# Scenario
Rotenrow Public Health Systems, a company that delivers digital health and technology solutions for public health programs has received three copies of the ServiceNow environment. One will be used for development work, one for testing, and one for production use after go-live. As a best practice, each instance should be marked so it is easy to determine which instance you are working in.

As a system administrator for Rotenrow Public Health Systems, I want to ensure that configuration changes are being made in the correct instance, developer instance.
