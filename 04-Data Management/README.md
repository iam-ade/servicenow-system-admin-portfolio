##  Scenario
The project team needs a way to track each of the VitaScope AR Field Device that are going to be distributed in the pilot and after product release. They need to track the user of each device, and the device's configuration using the device as the main data point but information about the device users, such as name and email, will also be available.

The Product Owner would like the list of devices added to the HHD application menu (HHDs and Assignees) and an option for creating new HHD records (Create New).

As the system administrator, I will create a new table to track new devices and assigned users, and a new form to collect device information that will be stored as a new record in this table. 

## Objective
Create a new table to track new devices and assigned users, and a new form to collect device information that will be stored as a new record in this table..

## Tasks Completed
- Create new table by extending the hardware table
- Include new field for firmware version
- Update application menu and add new module for device list
- Configure form for new device



## Result
Project team has a customized form for taking information about new device and device users, and a table to track new devices that have been distributed. For easy access to this list, a module is created in the application menu.
